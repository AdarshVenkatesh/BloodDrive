# BloodDrive
A platform for people who want to donate or request blood.
Used Facebook Graph API to fetch data from facebook pages to display the blood camp events in the application.
Facilitates push notifications, so that a user can send notifications to multiple users for requesting the blood. Used one signal REST API to achieve this.
